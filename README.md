## What I had tried to achieve
* Which areas are the huge market for our products to better target the customers.
* What time is best for the launch of Big Sales events like Flipkart does on its Big Billion Days and Amazon on its Great Indian Festival that helps them to lure huge customers into their Bussiness.
* Which type of Transactions do people prefer for the payments and from my analysis it's clearly visible that people go over the online transactions rather than COD as this will also help in reducing black money and customers can get more discounts from their bank's cards which will, in turn, give them a good experience on the shopping.
* Which products do people commonly buy in a particular state as this would help us in understanding the customer behavior and then we can give offers and discounts only on the product that people will mostly prefer to buy rather than giving to it to the random products like electronics that most sellers usually give.

## Further Analytics
* Sales of the products have got the most reviews
* Sales of the products that have got a very nice Description
* Delivery time of the products
* Sales of the products that have got the most clear and detailed photos
